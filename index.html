                <h3>The end of an era. </h3>
                <p>I drove a cab in the SF Bay Area for 15 years or so. Then I met my son's Mom, we married, became pregnant and learned that cab driving would not support us. So I shifted to clerical work and later, software development using the Microsoft Office suite. For the next twenty years or so I had a career in Tech Support. That ended in 2018. Crap. So . . . back to driving people for dollars. I did that until this spring (April 2023). Now that's done. <a href="rvabhc.com">Baugh Holding Company</a> will continue. Doing what? We shall see.</p>
